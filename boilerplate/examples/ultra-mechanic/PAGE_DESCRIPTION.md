## CUSTOMER REVIEWS (Google Reviews)

### Review 1

|-|-|
| **Author** | Martin Kowalczyk |
| **Rating** | 5 Stars |
| **Date** | 2 weeks ago |
| **Content** | "I've been looking for an honest mechanic in Wroclaw for a long time and finally found one! Mr. Chris immediately told me what needed to be repaired and what could wait. No pressure tactics, everything transparently priced. Timing belt + water pump replacement done in one day. Price lower than two other shops I visited earlier. Highly recommend!" |
| **Owner Response** | "Thank you for the kind words, Martin! We're glad we met your expectations. Come back anytime!" |

### Review 2

|-|-|
| **Author** | Anna Wisniewska |
| **Rating** | 5 Stars |
| **Date** | 1 month ago |
| **Content** | "The ladies at reception were very helpful, they explained everything over the phone right away. I came in with a strange noise in the suspension - turned out to be a loose cover. They fixed it in 15 minutes and didn't charge a penny! This kind of customer approach is rare. I'll definitely be back for my next service." |
| **Owner Response** | "Anna, we fix small things on the spot at no charge - that's just how we do things. Thank you for your trust!" |

### Review 3
| | |
|-|-|
| **Author** | Tom Mazur |
| **Rating** | 5 Stars |
| **Date** | 1 month ago |
| **Content** | "I've been using Ultra Mechanic for 5 years - all my cars (currently BMW E90 and wife's Mazda 3) are serviced only here. Always on time, always honest. Recently had clutch replacement in the BMW - done quickly, original parts, warranty on service. The mechanics know their stuff, you can see the experience. 10/10" |

### Review 4
| | |
|-|-|
| **Author** | Catherine Dabrowska |
| **Rating** | 4 Stars |
| **Date** | 2 months ago |
| **Content** | "Good shop, fair prices. Only downside - had to wait 3 days for an appointment because they have a lot of customers. But the service quality is top-notch, the car works flawlessly after the brake repair. They give warranty on parts and labor, which gives peace of mind." |
| **Owner Response** | "Thank you for the review! Indeed, we have many orders during peak season, but we try to serve everyone as quickly as possible. In the future, we recommend booking by phone in advance." |

### Review 5
| | |
|-|-|
| **Author** | Peter Adamski |
| **Rating** | 5 Stars |
| **Date** | 3 months ago |
| **Content** | "Roadside assistance in the middle of the night - they arrived in 25 minutes! Car wouldn't start after a concert at Centennial Hall. Turned out to be a dead battery + alternator problem. Towed to the shop, car ready in the morning. Professionalism at its finest, and the roadside assistance price was very reasonable." |

### Review 6
| | |
|-|-|
| **Author** | Michael Zielinski |
| **Rating** | 5 Stars |
| **Date** | 3 months ago |
| **Content** | "Pre-purchase inspection of a used car - the mechanic checked literally everything, did a test drive, connected the diagnostic computer. Found hidden issues the seller didn't mention. Thanks to this, I avoided buying a problematic car. 80 PLN for such a service is a laughable price for peace of mind. Great approach!" |
